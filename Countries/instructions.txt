For loops and if conditions

[ ] What are all of the countries that have “United” in the name?
[ ] What countries both begin and end with a vowel?
[ ] What country names are > 50% vowels?

Setting up storage to use during a for loop, including counters and arrays

[ ] What is the shortest country name? Make sure your solution can handle ties.
[ ] What countries use only one vowel in their name (the vowel can be used multiple times)
    - For example, if the word “BEEKEEPER” were a country, it would be an answer, because it only uses “E”.
[ ] There is at least one country name that contains another country name. Find all of these cases.
